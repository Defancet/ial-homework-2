This repository contains implementations of several fundamental data structures in C, focusing on hash tables and binary search trees (BSTs). The code provides both recursive and iterative approaches for BSTs, alongside a robust implementation of a hash table using chaining to resolve collisions.

## Files

- **hashtable.c**: Implementation of a hash table with chaining. Functions include initialization, search, insertion, deletion, and utility functions to handle collisions and hash calculations.

- **btree/rec.c**: Recursive implementation of a binary search tree. Includes standard BST operations such as insertion, search, deletion, and tree traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder).

- **btree/iter.c**: Iterative implementation of a binary search tree using stacks to manage state without recursion. This includes iterative approaches to tree traversals and node management.
